#A City of Spies

#Rules

In "A City of Spies," 3 - 6 players will take turns moving and capturing pieces, with the main goal being to have a member of your team as the last piece standing.

The game takes place in rounds, and each round ends when there is only one player remaining, who will earn 2 points for their team. The game ends when a team reaches 5 points.

###Set Up

#####Teams

Players start by seperating and choosing team cards. These Read: **B** or **W**

If you are playing with an odd number of people, the white team will have an extra player. 
>EX: 5 players - 3 W and 2 B'

Do not reveal your team!

#####Pieces
After teams have been assigned, all players must set up the board together so that they agree on placement, but make sure to first signify the building in the middle 8 squares of the board (non-possible spaces) (c4,c5,d3,d6,e3,e6,f4,f5).

The pieces that must be placed on the board are:
>2 Knights
>2 Bishops
>2 Rooks
>4 Pawns
>(Be sure to signify which piece in each pair is #1, or #2 (or 3, or 4 for pawns))
>1 Queen


After the pieces have been placed, each player must choose a piece by randomly picking from the pile of **Piece Cards**.

This card will determine each player's Life-Piece. If this piece gets captured at any point during the game, that player is out for the rest of the round.

Players should remember their **Life-Piece**, and then return all the Piece Cards back to the pile.

After every player has recieved a team and a **Life-Piece**, they must draw another card from the **Piece Card** pile. 
This second **Piece Card** is the player's **Target-Piece**, and will stay in the player's possession until the round ends. 

If a player's **Target-Piece** is captured during their turn, they *may* vocally recognize that their **Target-Piece** was captured, tell everyone which team they are playing for, and then add one point to their team's score.

If a player's **Target-Piece** is captured on someone else's turn, nothing happens, and that player will be unable to earn an extra point for their team.

###Round Start

Once every player has a **Life-Piece** and a **Target-Piece**, a new turn order needs to be established.

Each player will roll a die. Turns will be ordered starting with the player with the largest roll, and ending with the smallest.

Once every player is aware of the turn order, the first player's turn can begin.

###Turns

When a player's turn starts, they have the option to move any piece to any available square.

>Pieces move extactly as they do in Chess, however: 
>there is a **barrier** in the middle of the board that signifies an area where pieces cannot move to.
>Pawns can move one square in all directions, up, down, left, and right, and can capture in all diagonal directions.

if the player captures a piece, that piece is removed from the game. If that piece was someones **Life-Piece**, they must vocally recognize it, and that they are out for the round.

Once a player moves a piece, and all subsequent questions are answered, the turn passes to the next player in order.

Once all active players have played one turn, they must all re-roll the die and determine a new order for the next set of turns.

Continue these steps until there is only one active player remaining, that is when the round is over.

###Round End

When the round is over, the last active player must vocally recognize which team they are on, and then add two points to that team's total.

When a team reaches 5 points, the game is over.

If neither team has reached 5 points, reset the board, have all players agree on the placement, redraw **Life-Piece** cards, redraw **Target-Piece** cards, and begin a new round by rolling for turn order.
