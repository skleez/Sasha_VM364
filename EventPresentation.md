On March 22nd, I went to the Boston Unreal Meetup at the Jacob Wirth Restaurant on Stewart St. I was one of the first people there, and was able to start chatting with Seth Mantie, Unreal's Boston Coordinator. 
He told me about what goes on in their meetups each month, gave me a few stickers, and then asked me what I was doing there.
When I told him that I use Unity, and don't know much about Unreal, he scoffed and jokingly told me to write my name down, get "credit" for class for being there, and then leave. 
It might not have been a *good* joke, but it was clear he was very passionate about Unreal, and as more people started to arrive, conversations began to pop up about education, VR, storytelling, and anything interactive.
The guest speeker for the event was the Owner and Creative Director of Eagre Games, Chuck Carter. Chuck has been working in the Games Industry for a long time (He did the level design for Myst (1991)), but at the Unreal meetup he was showing off his company's new project "Zed".

The trailer doesn't reveal much, but it is obviously different from Command and Conquer (Another project Chuck worked on). 

After watching the trailer, I chatted with Mary E. Hopper, Ph.D., Founder and Owner of Digital-Den, about storytelling and games. Recently Mary visited an Emerson class to talk about VR storytelling, and specifically how different the media will be from film. She said the talk went very well,
however most of the students were very frustrated with the idea that VR film would require new techniques, and she said that she felt that Emerson's film program was stuck in the past. If you allow the viewer to move the camera, and even walk around, the techincaly perfect film-maker will be nothing but boring. 

After chatting with Mary, I walked over to two guys from a company called Neoscape who had a Samsung Gear VR headset. I tried it on for a bit while Zack Laznick, the Digital Artist at NeoScape, told me about how much more interesting the artist's images are for experiencing VR. 
He said that people's reactions are so much more powerful when they experience something imaginary as real, rather than, for example, a VR experience of an airport.

Toward the end of the meetup I was able to actually chat with Chuck and discuss his game. I asked him: "Are you an artist, or an engeneer?" and he responded with: "Well are you an artist or an engeneer?" We laughed a bit, but
the truth was there. Chuck didn't take a photograph, he didn't paint a painting, he didn't shoot a movie, but he still wants to call himself an artist. He didn't plan a bridge or invent a new plastic, but he still wants to call himself an engeneer. But it can be very hard to call yourself both at the same time.
There is a reason to make a game over these other things. To make a game you have to engeneer right and wrong choices, you have to engage the player, but ultimately it is about experience and emotion.
