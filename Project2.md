#Bean Pour
![title](http://i.imgur.com/os4GwJj.png)

The concept: This game originated after we were given several prompts in class. We had to come up with a game featuring jealousy and water. Originally, we came up with a cereal stacking game in which players had to stack their cereal on top of each other and could pour milk in other players' bowls. You would play against other players and be timed on how fast you can stack your cereal bowls without them tipping over.

###First iteration: 
When we had class at the Engagement Lab, we decided to paper prototype our game using red plastic cups two dice. 
Going around in a circle, players could either take two cups from the stack in the middle or take three cups from another player.


###Second iteration:
We wanted to make the game more engaging but also we did not want stealing to be too powerful. We started experimenting with the addition of beans to be a countermeasure against stealing. Players could gain beans and try to knock over other people's towers by throwing beans at the towers. This did not prove to be very effective.

###Third iteration:
We added the rule that players would start out with five right side up cups for their base. We still struggled with the fact that stealing was too powerful of a mechanism. We played through a round where players could not steal but it made the game go too slowly and it was boring so we scrapped that idea.

We experimented using small and big cups but eventually we found that bigger cups were more effective than smaller cups


###Fourth iteration
We play tested the game with our classmates. These are the rules we used when we playtested it during this iteration.

1.Players would start with a base of 5. They could place the cups however they liked but the cups were not moveable once placed.

2. To win, players needed to have their cups stacked four layers high

3. During each turn, players can
		Take two cups from middle or
		Decide to steal cups from other player for the chance of 1, 2, or 3 cups
				
Dice Roll: 1,2: 1 cup; 3,4: 2 cups; 5,6: 3 cups 

When you steal cups:
	if you knock over the other person's tower you’re out
	if you knock over your own tower you're out!

We played two versions of the game:

	Version A: No beans!
	
	Version B: When you decide to steal you have to add beans to the cup of the person you’re stealing from. The player you're stealing from rolls the dice too. If it’s a tie (aka they get the same number), then they pour the beans into your cup.

You can decide to skip your turn and you can pour the beans from the cup into someone else's tower 

Add beans (dice roll)

1,2: 2 beans

3,4: 4 beans

5,6: 6 beans

During this version, all the cups were stacked right side up


###PLAYTEST ADDITIONS:

Start with base of 5 (maybe 7) cups
Place as they like, immovable once placed 
 
CORE MECHANICS: 
-to win you need to have 4 cups high
-after you take your hand off cups they can’t move
-each turn you can:	

	Take two from middle or...
 	Fortify one cup from the middle upside down  or...
	Decide to steal cups from other player for the chance of 1, 2, or 3 cups or…	
		(Dice Roll: 1,2: 1 cup; 3,4: 2 cups; 5,6: 3 cups)
		(Add double the dice roll in beans to the target player’s well)
		(Cannot fortify with stolen cups)
	Pour from your well, sans cups
		(To fortify your tower, or knock someone else’s over)

When you steal cups:
if you knock over the other person's tower you’re out
if you knock over your own tower you're out!

Well of beans:
Add beans double the dice roll to your well.


We went through many iterations of the game. The rules changed but the core mechanic stayed the same. The ultimate goal was to stack your own cups to a certain level the fastest without knocking over your tower. 


#3/16/16: Final iteration

Start with 1 Bean Well, and 5 Foundation Cups, 2 of which can be upside down. First to a tower 5 high wins.

#3/21/16: Playtest
Playtesters thought the game was fun! They really enjoyed being introduced to the rules in 2 stages: "it was like a tutorial."

One criticism they had was that stealing was too strong, and could always stop a win. They recognized the chance of stealing 1-3 cups, but still felt the mechanic needed tweaking.

They also questioned the strength of the beans, because most of the times players poured beans on other peoples towers during this playtest, the towers stayed up.

The playtesters also had questions regarding what to do with extra cups. Multiple times the players had to place 3 cups, but only had space to safely place 2, and so the 3rd cup would just fall off the tower, and return to the center with no penalty or benefit for the player.

To deal with both criticisms, the playtesters suggested maybe letting players trade in cups for beans if they didn't want to place them (a face up cup could trade for 5 beans, and a face down cup could trade for 10).

This would allow players to have more control over the number of cups on their tower, as well as allow players a way to acquire beans for themselves.

Overall the playtesters really enjoyed the game. They thought it had good engagement and low confusion, and it was fun!

#How to Play:

-Each player starts with 5 cups for their base. Two cups can be upside down and three cups can be right side up

-Each player has a separate cup for their bean well

-Goal is to get their tower five layers high

###During the first round, players can:
1.Take 2 cups from the middle and add them upright to their tower

2.Take 1 cup from the middle and add it upside down to their tower

###Starting with the second round, players can:
1.Take 2 cups from the middle and add them upright to their tower

2.Take 1 cup from the middle and add it upside down to their tower

3. Steal from another player. In order to steal from another player, they must roll a six sided die. They can steal the corresponding number of cups from one or more players

	1 or 2 = Steal 1 Cup
	
	3 or 4 = Steal 2 Cups
	
	5 or 6 = Steal 3 Cups
	
After they steal, the targeted player adds twice the die roll in beans to their Bean Well.

	They can pour their beans onto their own tower to FORTIFY it.
	
	Pour their beans onto another player’s tower to knock it over.
	
If any non-foundation cups fall over, they are returned to the center. If a foundation cup is knocked over, it cannot be replaced.

A player loses the game if all of their cups are knocked over

The game goes on until a player successfully build their tower five layers high
