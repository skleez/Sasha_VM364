#A City of Spies

###Rules

In "A City of Spies," 3 - 6 players will take turns moving and capturing pieces, with the main goal being to have a member of your team as the last piece standing.
The game takes place in rounds, and each round ends when there is only one player remaining. 
This 'last piece' will earn 2 points for their team, with the game ending when a team reaches 5 points.

Players start by seperating and choosing team cards. 'These Read: B or W'
If you are playing with an odd number of people, the white team will have an extra player. 
    'EX: 5 players - 3 W and 2 B'
Do not reveal your team!

After teams have been assigned, players must choose a piece
